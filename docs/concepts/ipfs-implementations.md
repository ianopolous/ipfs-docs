# IPFS implementations

IPFS is an open-source project that encourages the development of multiple implementations of the protocol, each of which seeks to optimize for various use cases. Below is non-exhaustive list of IPFS implementations, grouped by development and maintenance status ([Popular](#popular), [Lite or Experimental](#lite-or-experimental) and [Inactive](#inactive)) and ordered alphabetically. To propose additions or edits, [edit this page in GitHub](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/edit/main/docs/concepts/ipfs-implementations.md) or [open an issue](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=need%2Ftriage&template=open_an_issue.md&title=IPFS%20Implementations).

::: tip
Looking into implementing IPFS yourself?

:::warning 
### js-ipfs being discontinued
Development of the [js-ipfs project](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) is being discontinued to focus on [Helia](https://github.com/ipfs/helia), a leaner, more modular, modern implementation of IPFS in JavaScript scheduled for release in 2023. To learn more about Helia and the current state of IPFS in JS, see the [blog post](https://blog.ipfs.tech/state-of-ipfs-in-js/). 

Because of this, js-ipfs tutorials may be out of date, and will eventually be archived.
